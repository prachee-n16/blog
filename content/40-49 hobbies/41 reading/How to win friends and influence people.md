Alright, using the "outline method" for some free-style note-keeping as I read through this the first time.
- Keep an "engagement book", keeping record of all appointments during the day. Then, use one evening from the week to check up on the progress you have been making.

### Fundamental techniques in handling people
**Chapter 1**
- [1] If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive
- Criticism is **futile** because the other person will get defensive and usually instead work on defending themself
	- It hurts their self-worth and fuels resentment; B.F. Skinner's experiments show animals work better under rewards for good behaviour, and worse under punishments for bad behaviour
- When receiving criticism, work on it (past the pain). 
- When giving criticism, know people have emotions that are motivated by pride
- [*] Don't criticize, condemn or complain

**Chapter 2**
- [2] The big secret of dealing with people
- The deepest urge in human nature is "the desire to be important". Freud calls it "the desire to be great".
- Sometimes, people become **invalids** in order to win sympathy and attention. 
	- People can go insane when this feeling of importance has been denied in the world of reality.
- Sincere appreciation and encouragement hence becomes the greatest tools in handling people i.e. getting them to do what you want.
- Flattery rarely works with discerning people; it is shallow, selfish and insincere. This is different from appreciation, by means of sincerity.
- [*] Give honest and sincere appreciation

**Chapter 3**
- [3] He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks.
- The only way on earth to "influence" people is to talk about what *they* want and show them how to get it.
	- Actions spring out of what we fundamentally desire.

> [!note] Quote
> Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: "How can I make this person want to do it?"
> That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly with futile chatter about our desires.

- Henry Ford puts this really well: If there is any secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.
- Note: Everyone needs to gain something in the end; don't simply follow the other person's desires without thinking about yours
- [*] Arouse in the other person an eager want

### Six ways to make people like you

**Chapter 1**
- [1] Do this and you'll be welcome anywhere
- You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
	- After all, we are interested in others when they are interested in us.
- If we want to make friends, put ourselves to do things for other people - things that require energy, time, etc.
- [*] Become genuinely interested in other people.

**Chapter 2**
- [2] A simple way to make a good first impression
- Actions speak louder than words, so when meeting new people, a smile speaks louder than anything you can possible say
	- have a good time with people if you want them to have a good time with you
- Don't feel like smiling? Force yourself to smile. Act as if you are already happy, and that usually makes you happy
	- It is not what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what **you think about it.**
- [*] Smile.

**Chapter 3**
- [3] If you don't do this, you are headed for trouble
- People place a lot of importance on their name; so, remember to get it right. Don't make fun of it or misspell it - it places you at a sharper disadvantage than you think.
- Most people don't remember names because they don't want to take the time and energy. We make excuses for ourselves; we are too busy. 
- [*] Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

**Chapter 4**
- [4] An easy way to become a good conversationalist
- Listen is one of the highest compliments we can pay someone; 
- People who talk only of themselves think only about themselves; and these people are "uneducated" T_T
- Being an attentive listener means: ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.
- [*] Be a good listener

**Chapter 5**
- [5] How to interest people
- It's a two step process: learn what interests the other person; then, become familiar with it to a certain degree.
- Having a range and diversity of knowledge is key to making a conversation enjoyable (while being aligned with the other person's needs)
- [*] Talk in terms of the other person's interests

**Chapter 6**
- [6] How to make people like you instantly
- There is one important rule of human conduct: Always make the other person feel important.
- How? When? Where? - All the time and everywhere.

- [*] Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely

### How to win people to your way of thinking

**Chapter 1**
- [1] You can't win an argument
- To get the best of any argument, the first step is to avoid it.
	- Someone will lose; As Ben Franklin said: If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve victory sometimes but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will
	- even worse, a man convinced against his will is still of the same opinion. So, despite being dead right, you have not changed the other person's mind.
- Arguments is people feeling their importance by loudly asserting their authority. 
- How to stop from disagreements from becoming arguments:
	- *Welcome the disagreement*; correct the issue before serious damage is done
	- *Distrust your first instincts*; Don't be defensive and keep calm at your worst
	- *Control your temper, Listen first*;
	- *Look for areas of agreement*; Dwell on the points you both agree
	- *Be honest*; 
	- *Promise to think over your opponent's ideas and study them carefully*; they might be right?
	- *Thank your opponents sincerely for the interest*; because for someone to argue with you means they are interested in the matter
	- *Postpone actions to give both sides time to think through the problem*; 
- [*] The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it

**Chapter 2**
- [2] A sure way of making enemies and how to avoid it
- Don't tell others they are wrong; use diplomacy.
	- Even the bible quotes this with: "Agree with thine adversary quickly"
- Saying "I am going to prove so and so" is almost tantamount to saying "I'm smarter than you and I'll tell you a thing or two to change your mind"
	- It arouses opposition and makes them want to battle you before you even start
- [*] Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "you're wrong"

**Chapter 3**
- [3] If you're wrong, admit it
- If you are wrong, it's easier to beat the other person to rebuke and do it yourself; Simple as that because self-criticism is easier to hear than from someone else's lips
	- By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected
- When we are right: try to win people gently and tactfully into our way of thinking
- When we are wrong: admit the mistake quickly with enthusiasm
- [*] If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically

**Chapter 4**
- [4] A drop of honey
- A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.
- Friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more quickly than all the storming in the world
- [*] Begin in a friendly way

**Chapter 5**
- [5] The secret of socrates
- Chinese proverb: He who treads softly goes far.
- The next time we want to tell someone they are wrong, remember Socrates and ask a gentle question which gets the "yes, yes" response.
	- Ask questions where the opponent will agree;
	- Keep on winning admission until you have multiple yes.
	- Without realizing it, they should reach their answer
- See: Socratic method
- [*] Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately

**Chapter 6**
- [6] The safety valve in handling complaints
- Most people try to win others to their way of thinking by talking a lot about themselves.
- Instead, let them explain and listen patiently with an open mind.
- [*] Let the other person do a great deal of the talking

**Chapter 7**
- [7] How to get cooperation
- No one likes it when they are being made to do something; people prefer to feel they are doing it of their own accord or acting on their own ideas
	- We want to be consulted about our wishes, wants, thoughts.
- [*] Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

**Chapter 8**
- [8] A formula that will work wonders for you
- Increased tendency to think in terms of someone else's POV is highly important.
- [*] Try honestly to see things from the other person's POV

**Chapter 9**
- [9] What everybody wants
- The magic phrase: "I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."
- Self-pity for misfortunes is a universal practice;

*Technology examples: CSV, TSV files*
- Stored in plain text format with specific field delimiters and row terminators
	- In CSV (comma-separated values), field delimiters = comma and row terminators = new line
		- First line may contain title to columns
	- Also, TSV (tab-separated values) with only difference being field delimiters = tabs
	- Space-delimited where spaces and tabs are used to separate columns
	- Fixed-width data where each field has fixed number of characters

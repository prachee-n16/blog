**Role Description:**

As a web engineering intern, you will work closely with designers, data scientists, and engineers that support the client platform and its infrastructure. You will be an active participant in design and code reviews, team processes, and product decisions. You'll participate in our educational culture, embracing opportunities to learn from X's community of peers across functions, as well as teaching us your strengths. You will use your passion and JavaScript knowledge to build on top of modern web APIs and frameworks, to craft client components and features that will shape the future of development of X.com.

We work on a new and clean code base that implements the industry's best practices. We are building a React/Redux app served by Node.js with the standard tooling (Webpack, Babel, ES6, Linting, Flow Typing, Prettier, etc). The data communication layer makes use of GraphQL to interact with a backend of microservices built in Scala. Many of the tools we use daily are open source and maintained by X.

We are looking for talented students to join us for an internship in 2024 to make X one of the best web page experiences out there. You are passionate about web development and have a passion for working on application architecture and design, and making smooth, delightful user experiences. You recognize that you're building software products for people, and understand that shipping involves collaboration and compromise. You care deeply about quality, are energized by partnership and collaboration, and you strive to enable others around you to excel. You have technical depth that allows you to rapidly fix bugs and solve problems. Knowledge of core CS concepts such as: common data structures and algorithms, profiling, and optimization

**Qualifications/ Requirements:**  
- Exposure to React web applications and Progressive Web Apps.  
- Currently pursuing an undergraduate or masters degree in CS or Engineering-related field  
- Able to commit to at least 12 weeks or more at NY or Palo Alto X Office location  
- In compliance with federal law, all offers are subject to verification of identity and eligibility to work in the US, and completion of the required employment eligibility verification form.

**Interview Questions**
*Technical*
- What is the difference between Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.forEach
- **Twitter tagged LC problems!**
	- https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/companies/twitter-front-end-interview-questions
	- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-interview-set-1/
- - Write a program to simulate a fair coin given two biased coins. Extend this to vary the head/tail probabilities of the given coins and the coin to simulate.
- Write a YAML parser.
- How would you design the architecture for Gmail?
- `Given an n-by-n matrix where each cell has a value of either 0 or 1 (1 indicates a wall), find the length of the shortest path from M[0][0] to M[n-1][n-1]. Movement is allowed in up, down, left, or right directions.`
- Given two strings, return whether the second string is an anagram of a palindrome of the first string.
- Find the k-th largest number in a list.
- `List all possible combinations of a phone number where each number can be represented by letters (e.g., 1 = [A|B|C]).`
- Given a vector of strings of length n with each word having a length of m on average, group all anagrams into a cluster.
- Determine if a binary search tree is valid.
- Find the single number in an array where all other elements are paired.
- `Given an array A[k], define the set S{k} := { A[k], A[A[k]], A[A[A[k]]], ... }. Write a program to count the maximum size of S{k}s.`
- Write a `getWithPrefix` function with a wildcard letter "*".
- Reverse a given string.
- How do you look up data in a trie data structure?
- https://prepfully.com/interview-guides/twitter-software-engineer
- You work for Twitter and you have some historical data about user login sessions. The data contains: a SessionID which can be assumed to be an integer, a UNIX time-stamp of the time a user logged in (session start time), and another UNIX time-stamp of when the user logged out (session end time).  Given a timestamp t, how would you find out the total number of users logged in at that time?

*Behavioural*
- What is your favorite feature on the app? Favorite account on twitter?

**Notes:**

**X - Evidence of Excellence**

- Designed and developed the automated software system for Nvidia’s manual bring up of embedded boards. This reduced embedded board setup from a 3-day manual process to a 90-minute automated task, saving countless engineering hours.
- Led the migration from 5 on-premise data centers to Amazon Web Services, encompassing 160 services in 6 months. Rearchitected legacy services to auto-scale/shut off per usage and optimized for lowest cost in dynamically priced cloud compute. This reduced HERE's application operations costs from $20M/year to $5M/year.
- Optimized Uber’s payment system to 6 nines of availability (was formerly 4 nines when first deployed). This payment system processes every single payment from Uber’s global offerings, and maximizing its reliability is saving tens of millions from transaction errors.

- While working at Empire Life, I designed and developed a high-performance gRPC and GraphQL CRUD service using Java Spring Boot (part of a Proof-of-Concept), resulting in a 30% reduction in latency compared to the existing REST interface. I demonstrated the service to the VP of Sales and Security, highlighting security measures implemented with Auth0, and cross-platform compatibility with terminal-based clients in Java, Python, and Go.
- Fast-tracked the transition of React/Chromium to React Native/Unreal Engine in Ford SYNC Infotainment system by 20%. This helped deliver the key features of the settings screen and improved the overall UI performance by 2x
- During my internship in NCR, I successfully migrated 90 test suites and 50+ features from the deprecated React Router to the new React Router v6 within two weeks, significantly improving browser navigation for a Bank Teller Application.

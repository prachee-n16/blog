**Role Description:**

**About Boomerang**  
At Boomerang, we're on a mission to revolutionize how employers stay connected with their former colleagues. We believe relationships matter and are here to provide a simple, affordable, and automated solution that keeps those connections alive.  
  
We are a seed-stage company (~ $5M in venture capital from Tier 1 funds) that has assembled some of the best builders, designers, and product minds to reimagine the future of work.  
  
We're seeking a Software Engineering Associate to join our Toronto office. This is an opportunity to join us on the ground floor, working alongside seasoned founders with a track record of successful companies. As a pivotal member of our growing team, you'll have the chance to make a significant impact and contribute to our collective vision.  
  
**Our Values**  
We believe values aren't just a top-down process but a collective effort. Our values: integrity, balance, growth, and results, guide us in decision-making and shape our behavior. We speak our truth, keep our promises, and trust each other. We embrace failure, curiosity, and continuous improvement. We ask questions without fear of judgment. We value harmony within ourselves, our team, and our community because we understand that it leads to better results. We look at outcomes over outputs and enjoy working hard (and having fun) together.  
  
**How We Work**  
At Boomerang, we are here to learn and become better leaders, managers, and people. You are encouraged to spend 80% of your time on core projects and 20% on innovation activities that pique your interests (including things outside of work). We enforce no meeting Fridays to allow time for these projects.

As a Software Engineering Associate, you will work on our engineering team on a broad range of technologies, developing features on the entire stack. We are looking for a motivated self-starting person that is willing to take on big challenges. You must also be an empathetic team member, who works well in a team environment and values communication and collaboration. Here are some of the things you'll be doing:

- Build reliable and scalable back-end functionality and APIs to power our front-end clients
- Build beautiful front-end experiences
- Make tweaks and improvements to our AI algorithms
- Participate in the whole lifecycle of code, design, development, review, deployment, and testing

- Kotlin, Spring Boot
- React
- MySQL
- Python
- Docker
- _Note: Not all of these technologies are required, if you have a subset of these we would love to talk to you!_

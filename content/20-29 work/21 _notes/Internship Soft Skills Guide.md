Alright, so this is a really cool way of learning "the architecture of code" and refactoring it for better results (a comment given to me by previous manager to improve on). Kind of wish he told me about this :)
- TLDR, add features to small programs (things you want to see) and then continue doing this practice but on larger programs. 

I thought this was a thread conversation with a lot of good advice: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/343x8z/lpt_request_internship_dos_and_donts/
- "My best interns were always dressed professionally, friendly, and on time": A good rule of thumb is dress like a person at work you respect (will really help with the issue I am facing). Either way, overdressed is better than underdressed.
- Good interns ask for feedback and when they get it, they make the change. 
- Interesting point, bring your own lunch twice a week; Let the gossip around you be that you are professional and hard-working, not drunk and flirty
- Go to socials, have coffee chats with senior people, and eat lunch with co-workers to form relationships
- Don't write **wordy** emails and maybe something to look into: ==How to write good emails in TECH?==
- "Take notes."

What are goals I want to have for this internship? When do I communicate this with my boss?

Unblock ASAP: "Ask your team for a list of access groups you need to be in and get your perms cleared up in one go. This saves time and effort for both you and your access manager."

Not taking anything from here but good read (for later) and more UW focused.

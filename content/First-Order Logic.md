Gödel's Theorems i.e. [[Gödel's Completeness Theorem]] and [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]] were important to AI.

From the completeness theorem, automatic theorem provers were created - In the 1950s, the Logic Theorist was made to show computers could process numbers and symbols.
- LISP and PROLOG: programming languages created to process symbolic structure

In the incompleteness theorem, we know that there are true statements which can not be proved. This shows the limits of using a logic-based system. Another limit is the Halting Problem i.e. there is no program that can decide whether a program runs in an infinite loop or not.

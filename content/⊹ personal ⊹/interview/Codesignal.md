Notes from [Coding Assessment Framework](https://github.com/Leader-board/OA-and-Interviews/blob/main/media/general-coding-assessment-framework.pdf)
- The score may vary depending on completion speed, code quality and # of incorrect attempts
- Question 1: 
	- Average time for solving ~10 minutes with 5-10 lines of code
	- Concepts will include:
		- working with numbers
		- string manipulation (split string into substrings, modify elements of string)
		- basic array manipulation
Example Problem: 
```
Given an array of integers a. The task is to return another array b where b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i+1] (if an element does not exist it should be 0)
```

- Question 2:
	- Average time for solving ~15 minutes with 10-20 lines of code
	- Concepts will include:
		- Working with numbers: Basic operations with numbers; Splitting numbers into digits
		- Basic string manipulation
			- Split string into substrings
			- Comparing strings
			- Modifying elements of a string
			- Concatenating strings
			- Reversing a string
		- Basic array manipulation
			- Iterating over an array
			- Modifying the elements of an array
			- Reversing an array
Example Problem:
```
Given a list of words (consisting of lowercase English letters) and a complex word written in camelCase (consisting of English letters), check if complex word consists of words from the given list.
```

- Question 3: 
	- Average time for solving ~20 minutes with 25-40 lines of code
	- Concepts will include:
		- Includes everything from the previous task. 
		- Splitting a task into smaller subtasks/functions. 
		- Manipulating two-dimensional arrays. 
		- Iterating over the elements in a particular order. 
		- Modifying values. 
		- Swapping rows/columns. 
		- Using hashmaps. 
		- Using built in hashmaps to store strings or integers as keys
Example Problem:
```
Given two strings, merge them with the following merge function: instead of comparing the characters in the usual lexicographical order, compare them based on how many times they occur in their respective strings. Fewer occurrences mean the character is considered smaller; in case of equality, compare them lexicographically; in case of equality, take the character from the first string.
```

- Question 4:
	- Average time for solving ~30 minutes with 20-35 lines of code
	- Concepts will include:
		- Working with trees
			- Storing and traversing trees.
			- Transforming trees
		- Understanding hashmaps. 
			- Solving tasks that require understanding the implementation of hashmaps
		- Fundamentals of discrete mathematics.
		- Brute-force search
			- Checking all possible solutions to find the optimal solution
Example Problem:
```
Create a data structure that allows the following operations.
insert x y - insert an object with key x and value y.
get x - return the value of an object with key x.
addToKey x - add x to all keys in map.
addToValue y - add y to all values in map.

Time complexity of each operation should be O(log(N))
```

**Interview Questions**:

Yeah so for BitComplete, for the first month or so I worked on an internal AI project that was primary gonna be used as like a leads generation and also to test another internal tools they were building. But the company works on both internal projects and client projects so I was put on a client project for the remaining 3 months, so the work is very dependent on the client project and I was working full stack on a web app.

So my compensation was $37.50/hr. 

Yeah so for the interview from what I remember it was a mix of questions from my resume and then also like 2 coding problems. I donâ€™t remember the coding questions being too bad like I was able to solve them both.

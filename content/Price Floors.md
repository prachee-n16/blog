A price floor is a government imposed legal minimum price that can be charged for a good/service. A government might choose to implement a price floor if they felt the free market price was TOO LOW. Thus, the newly imposed price floor would be ABOVE the previously established free market price. 

 **Examples and Purpose: 
- Minimum wage laws (to raise incomes of unskilled labor) 
- Certain agricultural markets (for guaranteed incomes of farmers; volatile income and to promote agriculture) 
- In Canada, dairy farmers have special assistance from government - "supply management" 
- Alcohol (to make alcohol loss affordable to prevent abuse)

There are more disadvantages to this then advantages. If we are thinking about the "pros":
- Some workers are helped because their wages rise. This allows them to buy MORE goods/services. This improves the quality of life. 
- Some employers will then experience higher revenues and they may in turn take more workers 

However, you can come up with a lot more reasons for why this is not a great idea:
- Some workers are hurt because they either lose their job as employers lay off workers or they now look for work they can't find a job. 
- Employers/ Firms are upset because now they have to pay their workers more. This increases their input costs and thus this lowers their profits. This gives firms/ employers the incentives to: 
	- Layoff workers to cut costs to offset the higher wages I must pay to my employers 
	- Raise the price of my products: The goal is to raise revenues to offset the lower costs. (* This will only work if PED is inelastic) 
	- Employers may offer lower quality inputs in an effort to cut costs. This lowers the quality of the good they produce. Consumers lose.  
	- Employers may choose to give existing workers LESS hours to work so as to effect the hourly pay raise. They must give their labor. The effect of this is that the total amount of take home pay workers get may not rise. 
	- Employers may eliminate benefits or perks for their workers (i.e. no more discounts on food) 
	- A black market may emerge. In this case, buyers and sellers of labour may illegally on a price (wage) BELOW the price floor. Workers have the incentive to work for less because they simply want a job. Employers want to lower their costs. The result is this works AGAINST the goal of the policy (which is to raise wages). 
	- Discrimination may occur. Due to the labor surplus, employers may now choose to 'avoid' hiring certain groups. (i.e. minorities, youth, disabled) 
	- Higher minimum wages may encourage higher dropouts of youth 
	- Employers may spend less time and money on training workers. 
	- Raising the minimum wages makes it LESS likely that is firms will expand and HIRE new labor. Thus, new jobs that WOULD have been created are NOT created.**

Why does the government still choose to do this? Think about the main goal: An alternative would be the government to give workers a wage subsidy but this would be a huge cost for the government.

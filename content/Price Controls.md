Price Controls: Government altered free-market prices; specifically if a govt feels that the current price of a good/service is too high or too low, the government will alter it.

There are two types: 
- Maximum prices ([[Price Ceilings]]) 
- Minimum prices ([[Price Floors]]) 

Note: When there is no government intervention, we have [[Market Failure|market failure]]

To know about something is not the same as knowing something.

The idea here is that we like collecting information, hoping that it will be useful down the way. However, this mindless collection of ideas is creating a fake sense of knowledge. We know the information but we don't actually break it down into our own ideas and words. 

Am I guilty of this? Possibly~ I noted that my review sheets during exams was helpful because I was taking the content and writing them down as possible questions. In a way, I'm breaking this down into how I actually was understanding the content. There is some deliberation in this method!

A good way to get out of this is: knowledge cycle!
- Read any text for an hour, and when the time limit is over, look back and see what you have learnt!

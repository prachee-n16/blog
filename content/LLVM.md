*Acronym for low level virtual machine, collection of compiler technologies*

It's a library that makes it easier to create new programming languages. A developer uses this API to create instructions in IR (intermediate representation) format, which LLVM can compile into a standalone binary or just-in-time compilation for interpreter.

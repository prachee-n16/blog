*The quantity of goods and services that consumers are willing and able to consume, at a given time, at all possible prices.* The "quantity demanded" or QD refers to the quantity of goods and services that consumers are willing and able to consume, at a given time, at any one possible price.

There's the **Law of Demand** where as price rises, the quantity demanded falls. As quantity demanded rises, prices fall. The law of demand occurs for two reasons: 
- The Income Effect: If the price of a good decreases, our purchasing power rises. We feel richer and we buy more. 
 - The Substitution Effect: If the price of a good decreases, we buy more of it and less of other goods. 
 
The only thing that causes a change in the quantity demanded of a GOOD is a change in the price of a good. Changes in prices causes changes in quantity demanded. Changes in prices don't cause changes in demand. 

**The demand curve slopes downward to the right due to LAW OF DEMAND.** Think of it like this:  
- Cause - the price of a good changes 
- Effect - QD changes

**What factors cause a change in demand? 
1. Change in population 
2. Change in consumer expectations 
3. Change in price of a complementary good 
4. Change in price of a substitute good
5. Change in tastes/preferences

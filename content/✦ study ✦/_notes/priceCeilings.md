title: Price Ceilings
---

**A price ceiling is a government imposed legal maximum price that can be charged for a good/service. 
- They might use this policy if the government feels that current free market price is too high. The price ceiling is then set below the free market price. 
- Price ceiling used in Canada/other North American Countries: Rent Controls 
*The way price ceilings work in reality is different than how they work in theory. This is theory.*

The government can attempt to shift the supply curve to right, until equilibrium reached max. price, with more being supplied and demanded. There are a number of ways: 
1. The government could offer subsidies to the firms in the industry to encourage them to produce more.  
2. The government could start to produce the product themselves, increasing supply 


There are a number of things that need to be evaluated when a government is considering the granting of a subsidy:  
- The opportunity cost of government spending on the subsidy in terms of other alternative government spending projects.  
- Although a subsidy allows consumers to buy products at a lower price, they may also be the taxpayers who are funding the subsidy. Who is paying the taxes?  
- What damage will it do to the sales of foreign producers who are not receiving subsidies from their governments?  
	- There is a great deal of international debate concerning the billions of dollars of subsidies that high-income countries give to their farmers as they lead to overproduction. 
	- It is argued that this is highly damaging to small-scale farmers in developing countries who do not receive subsidies themselves and then have to compete with the low prices charged by the farmers who do receive subsidies.  
	- High-income country farmers are accused of selling  products at prices beneath their costs of production. This is a major issue of contention at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

title: Equilibrium
---
In economics, this refers to a situation where in a market, quantity demanded = quantity supplied. Markets have a tendency to move towards equilibrium.  

Why? If the resulting price is **above equilibrium**, producers notice the surplus so they will produce less. Consumers react to the lower prices and buy more. This behaviour continues until equilibrium occurs. 

If the resulting price is **below equilibrium**, producers notice the shortage so they will produce more. Consumers react to the higher prices and buy less. This behaviour continues until equilibrium occurs. 

This alteration in demand and supply can be explained through [[elasticity|elasticity]].

The simple idea: There might be a conjecture that’s true, but there is no way to prove it.

- Why? There might be a gap between **truth** and **proof**.

First, mathematics might not be consistent (i.e. existence of paradoxes). We set down axioms - statements that are self-evidently true for all cases in our mathematical system.

- Before Gödel, the initial idea was: We can prove any statement in mathematics if we have a strong enough set of axioms.

Gödel Coding - Any mathematical statement could be turned into a unique number. A little bit of a simplification but imagine that if a statement can be derived from an axiom, both the numbers will be divisible by each other.

Gödel’s Challenge - Assume a statement cannot be proved from the set of axioms. This statement can be turned into a mathematical equation.

- Assume that statement is false. This means the statement can be proved from the set of axioms.
- Contradiction! We assumed this statement can not be proved, but now we have deduced it can be. Since we assume mathematics is consistent, this has to be false.

So, for any consistent mathematical system, there must be a statement that cannot be proved from the set of axioms.

The “regressive” solution is to add this as an axiom, but that’s not really a good solution. I can still find out a statement that’s not provable by the axioms.

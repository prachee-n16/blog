*Set of accessible addresses and their states*
1. Physical addresses: addresses available on physical memory
2. Virtual addresses: addresses each process sees

The virtual address space layout:
1. Code: stores the program's executable instructions
2. Data: stores the program's static data, both initialized and uninitialized
3. Heap: used for dynamically allocated memory during program execution
4. Stack: used for function calls to store parameters, local variables and return address
	- Stack pointer: points to top of the stack

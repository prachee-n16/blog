title: Positive Externality of Production
---
- Since we are looking at a positive externality of production, we will assume there are no consumption-related externalities:  ∴ MPB = MSB  
- The actual price and output on any externality diagram is always MPC = MPB 
- Since we are looking at a positive externality of production, this means that at all levels of output, SC < PC. Thus, ∴ MPC > MSC 
- The vertical distance between the MPC and MSC curves represent the size (or the extent) of the positive externality of production.  
- The socially desirable level of output always equates total costs with total benefits. So, this is where MSC = MSB. We will label the output Q*  
- When a positive externality of production exists, actual output ( Qe) < the socially desirable level of output ( Q*). Thus, the good is underproduced.  
- From  Q* to  Qe, the additional cost of production (MSC) is lesser than the additional benefits of consumption (MSC). This creates a potential welfare gain(a loss of economic welfare). 
 
Subsidise producers to create an increase in supply. This will shift the MPC curve to the left ideally to the location of the MSC curve. Thus, the new output would be the socially desirable level of output and potential welfare gain is achieved.

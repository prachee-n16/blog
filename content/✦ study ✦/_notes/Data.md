> [!tip] TLDR
> - Data can be structured, unstructured or aggregated
>	- Structured data is data that can be modelled. For example, text, numbers can fit into data tables
>	- Unstructured data is data that is hard to model due it's size or nature. So, audio, video or large text documents fit the bill
>	- Aggregated data is when multiple data sources are combined into one set. This is then used to create a statistical report that makes inferences about the population.

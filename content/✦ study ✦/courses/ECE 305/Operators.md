A mathematical object that acts or "operates" on a ket and transforms it into a new ket.
$$\hat{A}\ket{\psi} = \ket{\phi}$$
 $\hat{A}$ is a matrix operator; [[Quantum Postulates|Postulate]] 2 states that: A physical observable is represented mathematically by an operator A that acts on kets. 

There are special kets that are unaffected by a particular operator:
$$A\ket{\psi} = a\ket{\psi}$$This group is the "eigenvectors" of operator A and "a" represents the eigenvalues of the operator.

[[Quantum Postulates|Postulate]] 3 states that: The only possible result of a measurement of an observable is one of the eigenvalues $a_n$ of the corresponding operator $A$. 
- When a measurement is made, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of the observable, and the outcome of the measurement will be the associated eigenvalue.

Example: 
$$\hat{S_z}\ket{+} = +\frac{h}{2}\ket{+}$$
where $\hat{S_z}$ is the operator, $\ket{+}$ is eigenvector with $+\frac{h}{2}$ are the eigenvalues.

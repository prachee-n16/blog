What is the probability that $\ket{\psi}$ is found to be in the state $\ket{+}$ or  $\ket{-}$? Consider [[Quantum Postulates|Postulate]] 4 which states that:
The probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $\pm\frac{h}{2}$ in a measurement of the observable $S_z$ on the system in the state $\ket{\psi}$ is $P_{\pm} = |\braket{\pm|\psi}|^2$   where $\ket{\pm}$ is the normalized eigenvector of $S_z$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\pm \frac{h}{2}$. 

The quantum mechanical probability is found by squaring the inner product - $|\braket{\pm|\psi}|^2$ 
- We also call this inner product "probability amplitude" or amplitude

In this experiment,

- The first analyzer measure in the $\ket{+}$ state, and the second analyzer sees the state is $\ket{+}$ not $\ket{-}$ 
- Postulate 4 predicts the same where: $P_+ = |\braket{+|+}|^2 = 1$ and $P_- = |\braket{-|+}|^2 = 0$

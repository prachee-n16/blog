Describes the relationship between an object's temperature and the wavelength of the EM radiation it emits.
- **Black body**: idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation it comes in contact with; then, it emits thermal radiation in a continuous spectrum according to its temperature

**Overview**
- all objects emit electromagnetic radiation according to their temperature
	- colder objects emit waves with low frequency e.g. radio, microwaves
	- hot objects emit wave with high frequency e.g. visible light/ultraviolet 
- stars behave almost like black bodies; it's temperature is directly related to the light it emits.

A set B of vectors in a vector space V is called a basis if every element of V may be written in a unique way as a finite linear combination of elements of B.
- The unit vectors $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ form a "basis" for describing vectors in 3-D space: **normalized, orthogonal, complete**

**Properties**
- Normalization: Magnitudes are unity
$$\hat{i}\cdot\hat{i} = \hat{j}\cdot\hat{j} = \hat{k}\cdot\hat{k} = 1$$
- Orthogonal: Geometrically perpendicular to each other
$$\hat{i}\cdot\hat{j} = \hat{i}\cdot\hat{k} = \hat{j}\cdot\hat{k} = 0$$
- Complete: Any general vector in this space can be written as linear superposition of basis vectors
$$A = a_x\hat{i} + a_y\hat{j} + a_z\hat{k}$$

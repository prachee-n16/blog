The setup of this experiment involved:
1. a beam of neutral atoms
2. a region of space with an inhomogeneous magnetic field (i.e. varies in strength or direction throughout space)
3. detector for atoms

So,
- A particle has a magnetic moment $\mu$, and the potential energy $E$ of the magnetic moment in the field is: $E = -\mu B$. It results in a force of $F = \Delta (\mu B)$.
- In this experiment, the magnetic field gradient is primarily in the z-direction, $F_z = \mu_z \frac{\delta B_z}{\delta z}$ 
- This force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the particle; it deflects the beam in proportion to $\mu$ in the direction of the gradient field

The classical expectation is that the magnetic moment of the atoms could take **any orientation** relative to the magnetic field.
- When passing through the magnetic field, the beam should spread out continuously along the detector with atoms deflecting by different amounts
- The greater the magnetic moment along z, the larger the deflection in the beam.

However, in the experiment, instead of a continuous and spread-out distribution, the detector showed two distinct spots. 
- The discrete result shows that the magnetic moment is **quantized**
- Quantum spin - implies that the electrons in the silver atoms could only have two possible orientations for their spin angular momentum along the z-axis $\pm \frac{h}{2}$.

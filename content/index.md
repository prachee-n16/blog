Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my digital garden, a collection of notes on topics that have captured my interest and curiosity. Inspired by the [[Zettelkasten]] approach, my aim is to expand my knowledge and discover new insights.

This notebook will keep on changing and improving over time, so don't expect it to be perfect yet. Some pages might still be a work in progress.

While I'm still playing around with how I want to build my `second brain`, here are some basic principles I follow! My process for generating content for the second brain is based on the CODE system. This involves 4 steps: **C**apture, **O**rganize, **D**istill and **E**xpress. In brief,
- **Capture**: The idea is to capture information that is interesting, relevant or personal to me.
- **Organize**: I plan to write on a variety of topics, so organizing all these notes is key! The basic rule of thumb is PARA, which stands for **PROJECTS**, **AREAS**, **RESOURCES**, **ARCHIVE**. I'm also looking into tagging all notes as an alternative form of finding content in the future.
- **Distill**: Condensing information into the key points. This would be more critical when I am taking course notes or self-learning a topic.
- **Express**: With Obsidian, I want to use the Graph view to make connections across the various notes.

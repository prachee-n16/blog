# Hi there, I'm Prachee Nanda üëã

(Pronounced as: *prah-chi*, Hindi: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä).

Welcome to my homepage! I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the [[03 Resources/University of Waterloo]]. I'm interested in web development, machine learning, operating systems and tons of other stuff. I am currently a part-time co-op student at [Empire Life](https://www.empire.ca/) and Engineering Coordinator for [Technova Hackathon](https://itstechnova.org/) 2024.

This blog is a place to brain-dump things which I learn on a daily basis, and talk about my current/past [[03 Resources/Projects|projects]] and [[03 Resources/Work Experience|work experience]]. This notebook will keep on changing and improving over time, so don't expect it to be perfect yet. Some pages might still be a work in progress. Inspired by the [[02 Areas/NoteTaking/Zettelkasten]] approach, my aim is to expand my knowledge and discover new insights.

While I'm still playing around with how I want to build my `second brain`, here are some basic principles I follow! My process for generating content for the second brain is based on the CODE system. This involves 4 steps: **C**apture, **O**rganize, **D**istill and **E**xpress. In brief,
- **Capture**: The idea is to capture information that is interesting, relevant or personal to me.
- **Organize**: I plan to write on a variety of topics, so [[02 Areas/NoteTaking/Organization in PKM|organizing]] all these notes is key! 
- **Distill**: Condensing information into the key points. This would be more critical when I am taking course notes or self-learning a topic.
- **Express**: With Obsidian, I want to use the Graph view to make connections across the various notes.

Negative Externality of Production
1. Since we are looking at a negative externality of production, we will assume there are no consumption-related externalities:  ∴ MPB = MSB  
2. The actual price and output on any externality diagram is always MPC = MPB 
3. Since we are looking at a negative externality of production, this means that at all levels of output, there exist external costs. Thus, ∴ MPC < MSC 
4. The vertical distance between the MPC and MSC curves represent the size (or the extent) of the negative externality of production.
5. The socially desirable level of output always equates total costs with total benefits. So, this is where MSC = MSB. We will label the output Q* 
6. When a negative externality of production exists, actual output ( Qe) > the socially desirable level of output ( Q*). Thus, the good is overproduced.  
7. # From  Q* to  Qe, the additional cost of production (MSC) is greater than the additional benefits of consumption (MSC). This creates a welfare loss (a loss of economic welfare). 

**Solution:** 
The proposed solution to fighting this negative externality is to tax producers. This will cause a decrease in supply. This means MPC curve shifts to left, ideally to the policies of MPC curve as this will result in the socially desirable level of output being achieved and the welfare is eliminated. 

The government could legislate and could ban the polluting firms, or restrict their output in some way. It could also pass laws relating to measurable environmental standards in the firm's production units. To meet the standards, the firms would have to spend money, thus increasing their private costs.

Although taxes are seen as a way of making the polluter pay, there are some problems with this solution. First, it is often difficult to measure accurately the pollution created and to put a value on it, which can be regained by the tax. Second, it is also difficult to identify which firms are polluting and to what extent each firm is responsible for the pollution. Third, it is often argued that taxes do not actually stop the pollution from taking place.

One problem with this solution is that a ban or restriction may lead to job losses and the non-consumption of whatever was being produced, which may have been a valuable product. Also, the cost of setting and then policing standards may be greater than the cost of the pollution.

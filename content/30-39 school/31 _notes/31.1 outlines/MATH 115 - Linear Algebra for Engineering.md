> [!note] **Course Description**
> This is a course on linear algebra and its applications to engineering. Topics to be covered include complex numbers; vectors, lines and planes; systems of linear equations; matrices, linear transformations and determinants; introduction to vector spaces; eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonalization; the Gram-Schmidt algorithm and orthogonal diagonalization; Singular value decomposition (time permitting). We approach the material through a blend of theoretical ideas, computational methods and some applications.

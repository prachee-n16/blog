At University of Waterloo, an "option" is a specific combination of courses that add a secondary emphasis in another subject. It is similar to minors, but require fewer courses and more related to my major. 

I enrolled into this option just before my third year! So far, I am working on/completed:
- [[STV205 - Cybernetics and Society]]
- [[SYDE 522 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence]]

and plan on taking in the near future:
- [[ECE457C - Reinforcement Learning]]
- [[CS479 - Neural Networks]]
- [[ECE495 - Autonomous Vehicles]]

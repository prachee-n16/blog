This measures the responsiveness of a change in our consumption for ONE good given by a change in the price of another. We already know that changes in the price of another. We already know that changes in demand. XED measures to what extent will those changes occur. For example, yes…an increase in the consumption of Big Macs will affect the change in the consumption of Whoppers but BY HOW MUCH? And yes, an increase in the price of monthly cell phone plans will affect the consumption of cellphones BUT BY HOW MUCH?

Example 1: When the price of a good is $10, I'll buy 5 units of Good A. When the price of Good B rises to $12, I buy 8 units of Good A. 
```
**XED = +3/5 X 10/2 = +3**
```

Example - When the price of Good B is $ 200, I buy 4 units of Good A. When the price of Good B rises to $300, I buy 1 unit of Good A. 
```
XED = -3/4 X 200/+100 = -1.5 
```

A positive XED signifies they are substitute goods, while a negative XED signifies they are complementary goods.

Firms need to be aware of the XED for the products that they produce. It is essential that firms are aware of the possible impact on the demand for their products that may arise if there is a change in the price of a close rival’s products. In the same way, they need to be aware of the impact of any change in price that they make on the demand for their close rival’s products. 

In addition, firms that produce complementary products, such as power tools and accessories, need to be aware of the effect that any price change they make on one product might have on the demand for complementary products that they also produce.

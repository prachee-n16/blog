My process for adding content is based on the CODE system. This involves 4 steps: **C**apture, **O**rganize, **D**istill and **E**xpress. This note details on the "Organize" step i.e. how I have organized my PKM, and some basic principles I follow. 

It is a hybrid of various organization styles out there:
1. [[Johnny Decimal System]] that organizes content into numbered folders and sub-folders. The motive was to have related notes in the same place and I like the numbered system. The goal here is just having a note live in a sensible and structured place.
2. Linking Your Thinking: It's a spin to Zettelkasten. The main principle I am adopting is connecting notes and relating information together.
3. MOC: From **Linking Your Thinking**, this involves making a table of contents on a particular topic with links to all notes on that topic. It's more about keeping track of "ongoing" efforts at a bird's eye view.

**Note Tags**
i.e. "status" tags I can apply to notes to provide some meta-information on them. I've documented most (if not all) tags I plan on using:

- `Desk_Urgent`: Functionally, "putting it on my desk" - These are notes that require urgent action. 
- `Pin/*`: Bringing the concept of Pinterest boards into the Vault. Using these tags on notes to group together documents of the same "vibe"
	- `Pin_Idea`
	- `Pin_Mindset`
- `To_*`: Notes that need future action
	- `To_Do`: These are notes I need to return to complete
	- `To_FactCheck`: Self-explanatory
	- `To_Investigate`: This is a rabbit-hole I need to explore more, topic to research 
	- `To_Digest`: Overlaps with the above but refers to media I need to look into

**Failed Experiments**
Here's a list of things I've tried but didn't really work out and why:
- [[Zettelkasten]]: On paper, this is what I aspire my note-taking system to be like. However, it's a lot of **time** and **effort**. The key idea is writing notes from sources in my own words, and create "atomic" notes i.e. notes on a single idea. Then, interconnect atomic notes to link these thoughts.
	- As a student, spreading a topic over multiple "atomic" notes makes it difficult to review later for exams. 
	- Also, sometimes, I do want to jot down *information* or *data* regarding a topic because it's useful to have.
- **Subject-based Tags**: I tried looking into tagging all notes as an alternative form of finding content in the future. It turned out to be high effort for low value, so I scrapped it pretty early on.

These are internal to the compiler; intermediate forms that compilers translate between during compilation process
- They are ordered by level of abstraction (highest is source; lowest is assembly)
- It is useful because lower levels expose features hidden by higher levels:
	- registers
	- memory layout
- At the same time, they obscure high-level meaning
- This balances the benefits that both levels provide.

title: SOAP
---
*Simple Object Access Protocol* is a message protocol that enables the distributed elements of an app to talk to each other. If there are different programming languages, they can be communicated using SOAP. They create Web API's with XML, supporting a wide range of communication protocols across the internet.

In these XML documents,
- Envelope has all the data in a message and identified XML document as a SOAP message
- Header element which might have authentication credentials
- Body element which has details of the actual message that needs to be sent from web service to calling applications

How does it work? Request for a service is generated by client in XML document

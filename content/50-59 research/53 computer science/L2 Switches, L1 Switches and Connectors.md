**L2 or layer 2 switches**
L2 switches operate at the **Data Link Layer**. A Cisco L2 switch of model SF300 24P; where the name implies:
- SF300 (series name)
- **24**: This indicates that the switch has 24 Fast Ethernet ports.
- **P**: This stands for **PoE** (Power over Ethernet),

Also, in addition to this:
- 24 10/100 BASE-T PoE (Power over Ethernet) ports
	- These are Ethernet ports that support speeds of 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps
	- BASE: basement signal; it is not a modulated signal
	- PoE: These ports can deliver electrical power over the Ethernet cables to connected devices
- 4 Gigabit ports: high-speed ports; 
- 2 Fiber ports
The cost of these connectors are determine by 

**L1 or layer 1 switches**
L1 switches operate at the **Physical Layer**. So, model name of "**48 10/100/1000 BASE-T ports (RJ45)**" indicates the following characteristics about the specs:
- **48 ports**: The switch has 48 Ethernet ports.
- **10/100/1000 BASE-T**: These ports support three different speeds:
    - **10 Mbps** (Megabits per second)
    - **100 Mbps**
    - **1000 Mbps** (also known as 1 Gbps, Gigabit Ethernet)
- **RJ45**: This refers to the type of connector used for these ports, which is the standard connector for Ethernet cables (commonly used in networking).

For model name of "**4 1000 BASE-X Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) optics ports**"
- **4 ports**: The switch has 4 of these ports.
- **1000 BASE-X**: These are Gigabit Ethernet ports designed for use with fiber optic cables, supporting speeds of 1 Gbps.
- **SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable)**: These ports are modular and can be fitted with different types of transceivers (SFP modules) depending on the network needs, such as fiber optic or copper connections.

Note: BASE represents Baseband (bits are not modulated) and T represents Twisted pair of copper (to cancel out electromagnetic interference)

**Connectors**
- Common copper connectors are category 6 cables support
	- **10 BASE-T (Ethernet)**:
	    - This refers to Ethernet networks that transmit data at **10 Mbps** (Megabits per second). 
	- **100 BASE-T (Fast Ethernet)**:
	    - This refers to Fast Ethernet networks that transmit data at **100 Mbps**. Cat.6 cables support this speed as well.
	- **1000 BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet)**:
	    - This refers to Gigabit Ethernet, which transmits data at **1 Gbps** (Gigabit per second or 1000 Mbps). 
	- **10 GBASE-T (10 Gigabit Ethernet)**:
	    - This refers to 10 Gigabit Ethernet, which transmits data at **10 Gbps**.

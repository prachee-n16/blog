End to end resources are allocated to a path, which is reserved for a call between source and destination. 
- There are dedicated resources, so no sharing with circuit-like performance (i.e. guaranteed)
- The circuit will be idle if there are no calls (i.e. no sharing during idle time either)
Commonly found in telephone networks

The traditional approaches are FDM and TDM
1. Frequency division multiplexing
   Done in practice by cellular networks; not the internet. Divided into subchannels, it allows users to communicate synchronously.
2. Time division multiplexing
   This is a slotted time model where users take turns in using a given time slot. In the case of LTE networks or GSM networks

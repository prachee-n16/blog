Finite automata are abstract machines used to recognize patterns in input sequences.

##### Types of Finite Automata
There are two types of finite automata:
1. Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

A DFA can be defined as a tuple:
```
M = { Q, Σ, q, F, δ }, where:
- Q: Finite set of states
- Σ: Set of input symbols
- q: Initial state
- F: Set of final states
- δ: Transition function
```

Note - For every state, there is a transition for every symbol in the alphabet. Also, the machine transitions to one and only one state.

To accept a string: 
- The entire input string must be scanned and the last state must be accepting
To reject a string: 
- The entire input string must be scanned and the last state must be non-accepting

2. Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)

NFA is similar to DFA but includes the following features:
- It can transition to multiple states for the same input.
- It allows null (ϵ) moves, where the machine can change states without consuming any input.

**Proof: Languages Generated by Regular Expressions are Regular Languages**
1. Syntax-Guided Translation from Regex to NFA
	- **Goal**: Convert a regular expression to a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA).
2. Transform NFA to DFA
	- **Goal**: Convert the NFA to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to ensure deterministic processing.
3. Minimize DFA
	- **Goal:** Reduce the DFA to its minimal form, thereby optimizing its state representation.

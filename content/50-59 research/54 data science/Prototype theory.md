We encode an "ideal" version of the category and to classify a new item, we see how close that new item is to the ideal prototype. 
- For example: We have an "ideal" image of a dog, and future dogs are classified by us based on this ideal image. 
	- We believe dogs will have tails and ears ideally! This also can create incorrect categorizations if similar animals match this ideal

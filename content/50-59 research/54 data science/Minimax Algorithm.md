Decision-theory concept. For simplicity, let's consider it in the context of a two-player zero sum game like tic-tac-toe.

Let there be two players, X and O (their names represent the symbols they need to win on the board). When X wins, let's say the "value" of that board is 1 and when O wins the "value" is -1. If it's a draw, we assign a 0 to the board value. At any point in the game, X wants to maximize and O wants to minimize.

If we start from board 1, let's chart out all possible states the game will end up in. We keep branching out until we come across an end game situation.

Working bottom-up, board 5 and 6 can be said to have a value -1 because it leads to a win for O. Board 2 then must also lead to an eventual win for O, so it has a value of -1.

In board 3, we come across two situations: either X wins or O wins. Since the goal is to maximize, we say that the board has a value of 1 (max of both the possibilities).

Note: We need to explore several states to make the right choice. While this works out easy for simple games like tic-tac-toe, that's not the case for more complex situations.

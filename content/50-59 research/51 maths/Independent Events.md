Two events $E$ and $F$ are independent if:
$$P(EF) = P(E)P(F)$$
then $P(E|F) = P(E)$ and $P(F|E)=P(F)$.

In the case of three independent events, we can extend to:
$$P(EFG) = P(E)P(F)P(G)$$
$$P(EF) = P(E)P(F)$$
$$P(EG) = P(E)P(G)$$
$$P(FG) = P(F)P(G)$$

Essentially, the probability of the intersection of any subset of independent events is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

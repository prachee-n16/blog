What is probability theory, and how is it different from statistics?
It's analogous to the difference between math and physics. Physics uses mathematical models i.e. hypotheses and test the models based on measured data to prove some theory.

Probability theory: The branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena
Statistics: It's the science of collecting, analyzing, presenting and interpreting data.
- By definition, statistics is using probability theory to create models and hypothesis, like how physics uses maths.
i.e. the difference is whether there is any data available to make a reasonable assumption with. 

**Sample space and events**
- Random experiments don't have predictable outcomes and the set of all possible outcomes is called sample space $S$
Review the various examples for sample space calculations, increases in complexity 
- In Example 2.4, time can not be non-negative and is any real number
- In Example 2.5, the bounds are set because it can not be outside that range and it's a real number

A subset $E \subset S$ is called an event. For example, when both coins appear identical, that event is defined as: $E \subset {hh, tt}$ 
Review the various events, subsets of sample spaces defined above.
- **In roulette, 0 and 00 are not considered even or odd. This means you have less than 50% chance of winning**
Space $S$ is an event, and an empty space also counts as an event.

For 2 events $E$ and $F$, 
- $E \cup F$   is the event that either E or F occurs
- $E \cap F$ is the event that both E and F occurs, also written as $EF$
- $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive when $EF$ is null set.

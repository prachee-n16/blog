Resources:
- these three books are all you need to understand the current AI taxonomy: 
  1. Building LLM from Scratch 
  2. Hands-On LLM 
  3. LLM Engineer's Handbook 
	  - the first book will help you understand LLMs from first principles to training your own LLM. 
	  - the second and third books will teach you how LLMs work in production environments, including RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, inference optimization, and MLOps (covered in the third book). 
	  - you don't need to read the last two books cover to cover; they are all available on O'Reilly.

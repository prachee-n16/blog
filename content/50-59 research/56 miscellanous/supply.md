title: Supply
---
*The quantity of a good or services that a producer is willing and able to produce, at a given time, at all possible prices*. The "quantity supplied" or QS refers to the quantity of a good or service that a producer is willing and able to produce, at a given time, at one possible price. 

Most importantly, we have the **Law of Supply**: As price rises, the quantity supplied rises. As prices falls, the quantity supplied falls. (This supply means that higher prices motivate that producers to produce more and lower prices motivate them produce less) 

Note: Supply curves slope upward to the right due to law of supply. A change in price doesn't causes a change in quantity supplied but a change in quantity supplied a change in price.  

**What causes a change in supply?**
1. Change in number of producers 
2. Change in tastes of producers 
3. Change in subsidy for producers 
4. Change in taxes 
5. Change in technology 
6. Change in weather 
7. Change in price of production substitute 
8. Change in input costs

Also, known as common-pool resources and common property resources, these are typically natural resources that are difficult and expensive to exclude people from using. Unlike public goods that don't reduce availability for others, common access resources decrease the available goods for others.  These goods are non-excludable and depletable. 
**Examples: Fishing Grounds, Forests**

Common access resources are types of market failures because the goods are negative externalities of consumption.

title: Positive Externality of Consumption
---
- Since we are looking at a positive externality of consumption, we will assume there are no production-related externalities:  ∴ MPC = MSC  
- The actual price and output on any externality diagram is always MPC = MPB 
- Since we are looking at a positive externality of consumption, this means that at all levels of output, SC > PC. Thus, ∴ MPC < MSC 
- The vertical distance between the MPC and MSC curves represent the size (or the extent) of the positive externality of consumption.  
- The socially desirable level of output always equates total costs with total benefits. So, this is where MSC = MSB. We will label the output Q*  
- When a positive externality of consumption exists, actual output ( Qe) < the socially desirable level of output ( Q*). Thus, the good is under consumed.  
- From  Q* to  Qe, the additional cost of production (MSC) is lesser than the additional benefits of consumption (MSC). This creates a potential welfare gain(a loss of economic welfare). 

**Solution:**
We could use positive advertising to increase demand. This should shift MSB curve to the right. Thus, the new actual output is the socially desirable level of output and potential welfare gain is eliminated.  
 
Subsidise producers to cause an increase in supply. This would shift MPB = MSB curve to MPB2 = MSB2 curve. Now,  the new actual output is the socially desirable level of output and potential welfare gain is eliminated.

**Background**

- [Fundamentals of C](https://prachee.me/notes/Fundamentals-of-C)
- [Socket Programming](https://prachee.me/notes/Socket-Programming)

**Idea**: Not to reinvent the wheel but to learn more about the wheel HTTP is just text, a protocol for browsers to send and receive information from servers. The steps in completing this project are outlined here:
- Create a bare-bone HTTP server that uses sockets.
    - Implement error-handling for a _graceful exit_
- Create a [HTTP parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) eventually

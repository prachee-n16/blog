For any collection of first-order statements, every semantic implication of those statements is syntactically provable within first-order logic.

Simply put,
- all statements which are true in all models are provable

First-order logic
- Includes quantifiers e.g. $\forall$, $\exists$, predicates e.g. greater than, equal to and logical connectives e.g. and, or etc.
- Allows relations between objects, definition of functions

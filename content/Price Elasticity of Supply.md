It is a measure of the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price. In other words, it measures to what extent a change in price will alter how much a firm choose to produce. 

Most good/ services have either an Inelastic supply or Elastic supply.

Inelastic Supply 
Any % change in price will cause a smaller %change in quantity supplied. 
- Quanitity Supplied is relatively unresponsive to any change in price 
- %Change in price > %change in quantity supplied 
PES < 1 
 
Elastic Supply 
Any % change in price will cause a larger %change in quantity supplied. 
- Quanitity Supplied is relatively responsive to any change in price 
- %Change in price < %change in quantity supplied 
PES > 1 
Except for time frames, the factors that affected whether or not PED was inelastic or elastic have NOTHING to do with Price Elasticity of Supply.

Price Elasticity of Supply is a relavant concept when there is a change in DEMAND.

| Short Term Time Frame <br>e.g. Whistle makers can react immediately <br><br>Perishable Items <br>e.g. Florists and farmers can't send their items back because they only last for so long <br><br>Spare Capacity (idle labor and machinery) if all [[Factor of Productions\|factor of production]] aren't being utilized <br>    <br>Immobile factors of production <br>e.g. a company is producing shoes and PC's. If one decides to switch, it is difficult because there are no similar materials. <br>    <br> | Long Term Time Frame <br>e.g. Farmers can't grow more crops if there is an increase in demand since the products need time to create <br>    <br>Non-perishable Items <br>e.g. Hole-punchers can be sold and remaining products can be shelved back because they have a longer shelf-life <br>    <br>Capacity Issues (Factor/ Industry is near capacity) <br>e.g. If all factors of production are already being utilized) <br>    <br>Mobile factors of production <br>e.g. a company is producing hockey sticks and baseball bats. If one decides to switch, it’s easy because the input materials have multiple uses <br>    <br>Labour has multiple uses |

**3 Rare Scenarios:**
- Perfectly Inelastic Supply - Quantity Supplied is completely unresponsive to any percent change in price. In other words, when price changes, producers can't or won't alter their output.  PES value - 0 and the supply curve is a vertical line 
- Perfectly Elastic Supply - Quantity Supplied is infinitely responsive to any percent change in price. PES value is infinite and the supply curve is a horizontal line. 
- Unitary Supply - any %change in price will cause an equal change in quantity supplied. For example, if price rises 4%, quantity supplied rises 4%. PES value = 1.

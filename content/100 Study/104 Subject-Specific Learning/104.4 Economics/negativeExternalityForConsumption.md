title: Negative Externality of Consumption
---
- Since we are looking at a negative externality of consumption, we will assume there are no production-related externalities:  ∴ MPC = MSC  
- The actual price and output on any externality diagram is always MPC = MPB 
- Since we are looking at a negative externality of consumption, this means that at all levels of output, PB > SB. So, the MSB curve lies below MPB curve. Thus, ∴ MPB > MSB 
- The vertical distance between the MPB and MSB curves represent the size (or the extent) of the negative externality of consumption.  
- The socially desirable level of output always equates total costs with total benefits. So, this is where MSC = MSB. We will label the output Q*  
- When a negative externality of consumption exists, actual output ( Qe) > the socially desirable level of output ( Q*). Thus, the good is overconsumed.  
- From  Q* to  Qe, the additional cost of production (MSC) is greater than the additional benefits of consumption (MSC). This creates a welfare loss (a loss of economic welfare). 

One option is to use negative advertising that informs citizens of the harm caused by consuming the good. This is meant to change people's hearts. In other words, it is hoped to cause a decrease in demand. Thus, shift the MSB curve to the left ideally to the new location of MSB curve. Thus, the new actual output (Qe2) is the socially desirable level of output. Thus, the negative externality and welfare loss have been eliminated.  
 
A second option is to tax producers – it is an indirect tax passed on to consumers. It will cause a decrease in supply. Thus, MPC = MSC falls to MPC2 = MSC2. The new output Qe2 is the socially desirable level of output and welfare loss is eliminated.

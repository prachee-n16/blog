title: Ethics in AI

**AI and Society**
- The big question has always been **will AI destroy jobs**?
    - AI will replace the unpleasant or dangerous jobs, completing tasks with more efficiency and precision
    - Rise of AI accelerates _growth/consumption spiral_
        - Companies want to lower prices, laying off workers to cut costs
        - Lower prices is higher demand, so higher production (using more resources here)
        - In modern countries, where population doesn't grow, individual person must consume more (marketing helps with this!)
    - More people left unsatisfied (consuming goods they don't want, high unemployment etc)
    - There needs to be an "economy for the common good" where we go for sustainability, rather than profit

**Filter Bubbles** The goal of content recommendation systems, especially those used in social media/newsfeeds, is to provide personalized searches. The unintended effect can be an _intellectual isolation_ - you keep being offered curated results, but you find yourself in a bubble of only your own ideas.
- How is this different from an epistemic bubble? In this situation, the user never gets the information by fault of the algorithm. Epistemic bubble is that the opposing view is simply left out.

**Echo Chambers** Stemming from filter bubbles, we see echo chambers: Users come across content that only amplifies & reinforces their beliefs. Essentially, it's confirmation bias.

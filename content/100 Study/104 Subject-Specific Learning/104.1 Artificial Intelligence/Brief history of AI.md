Interest in AI has been there for a long time (See fictional stories: Frankenstein, R.U.R.)
- Field of Automata: Ismail al-Jazari is credited as father or robotics where he creates self-operating machines
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/lbwldq/designed_in_the_late_1770s_this_incredible_little/
	  Designed in the late 1770s this incredible little robot called simply The Writer, was designed and built by Swiss-born watchmaker Pierre Jaquet-Droz 
	  - Frankenstein and R.U.R are stories about building something that exhibits human behavior 
		  - R.U.R: Rossum's Universal Robots; robot means slave. Play is about artificial people being slaves for humans; things go bad as they do 
- 1948: **Grey Walter's Tortoises**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLULRlmXkKo
	- As we are able to build these complex electronic machines, we start to see the rise of the first "robots"
	- *Elmer and Elsie*: Described as tortoises because of slow rate movement; capable of finding their way back to charging stations i.e. **phototaxis**
- 1950: **The Turing Test**
	- Can we distinguish between AI and human behavior?
- 1951: **Checkers and chess** bots; using AI bots to play against humans
- 1956: **Dartmouth Workshop**: triggers the following incredible wave of innovations. See [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop)
- 1957: [**General problem solver**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver)
- 1958: **[[Perceptrons]]** First computers to be able to identify or classify images
- 1964: **ELIZA** First chatbot 
- 1968: **SHRDLU** program for understanding natural language
- 1969: **Perceptrons (the book)**, summarizes a lot of the research that has happened so far.
- 1970-1980: The first *AI winter* where no major breakthroughs are made due to challenges being faced in the field
- 1980: Expert systems and **XCON**; Organizes a decision-making process that allows for automation. In commerce, this was specially useful to help organize transactions that are usually guided by a set of rules
- 1984 - present: **Cyc**: Idea was to create a big knowledge database that contains all the information in the world. Essentially, a "Wikipedia" of a lot of facts to allow for rule-based logic checks
- 1986 - **Backpropagation**; core workforce of neural networks
- 1989 - **Deep Thought**: Chess bot
- 1989 - 2006: A smaller winter with drop in hype for AI
	- 1992: **TD-Gammon**; Backgammon program that allowed even experts to learn more tricks and tips
	- 1992: **SVM**; refinement of Neural Networks
	- 1997: **Deep Blue**: Chess bot, beats Gary Kasparov 
	- 2006: **Deep Belief Networks** 
- 2012: **AlexNet**: pioneering convolutional neural network (CNN) used primarily for image recognition and classification tasks
- 2014: **Neural Machine Translation**
- 2014: **GANs and DeepFakes**
- 2015: **AlphaGo**: playing Go instead of Chess
- 2015: **AlphaGoZero**: playing Go without watching humans play; learns on it's own
- Post-2020: **ChatGPT, DALL-E etc**

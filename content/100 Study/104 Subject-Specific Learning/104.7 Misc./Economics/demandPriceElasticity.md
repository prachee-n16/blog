title: Price Elasticity of Demand
---
The price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded given by a change in price. In other words, it measures to what extent we alter our consumption of a good or service. 

Since the price changes, the PED values change. Price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded and the percentage change in price. **Similar change in magnitude are not similar in percent terms.**

For example, if I increase price from $5 to $10, there is a 100% increase in price. However, if I increase price from $50 to $55, that the some $5 increase is a 10% increase. 

Most goods/ services have an elastic or inelastic demand. 
Elastic demand
- Any percent change in price will cause a larger percent change in quantity demanded 
- Percent change in price < Percent change in quantity demanded 
- Quantity demanded is relatively responsive to a change in price 
P.E.D values > 1 

Inelastic Demand:
- Any percent change in price will cause a smaller percent change in quantity demanded 
- Percent change in price > Percent change in quantity demanded 
- Quantity demanded is relatively unresponsive to a change in price 
P.E.D values < 1

>[!important] Review
> Steep demand curves illustrate inelastic demand and relatively flat demand curves illustrate elastic demand. This is only kind of true.  
> 
> - YES, a steep demand curve will be more inelastic than a flat demand curve but along any downward sloping demand curve, PED values change! 
> - There will be an elastic position at the Upper end, an inelastic portion at the lower end and somewhere in the middle, PED is unitary. 
>  
> At the upper demand of the curve, unit changes in price are small in % terms and unit changes in quantity are bigger in %terms. Thus, PED is less. 
> 
> At the lower demand of the curve, unit changes in price are larger in % terms and unit changes in quantity are smaller in %terms. Thus, PED is more.**

**So, how to determine whether a good has Elastic/Inelastic Demand?

| Inelastic Demand                   | Elastic Demand                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Necessities                        | Luxuries                         |
| Short-term time frame              | Long-term time frame             |
| Items with few substitutes         | Items with many substitutes      |
| Item is a small part of the budget | Item is a big part of the budget |
Here are some rare scenarios: 
- Perfectly inelastic demand - any percent changes in prices will cause NO change in quantity demanded. Quantity demanded is completely unresponsive to any change in price.
- Perfectly elastic demand - quantity demanded is infinitely responsive to even the small percent change in price
- Unitary demand in any percent change to price causes an equal percent change in quantity demanded. Therefore, if price rises by 5%, QD falls by 5%. PED values remain at 1.

**Significance of PED given by a change in supply**
An equal change in supply on equilibrium but with different outcomes.  

*Results:* 
In the elastic supply curve, a change in supply leads to a small increase in price but a significant increase in quantity demanded.  

In the inelastic supply curve, a change in supply leads to a significant change in quantity demanded but a small change in price. 

**Significance of PED on Price and Total Revenue**
Every producer wants to increase their total revenue. Total Revenue is related to number of unit sold but what strategies must be used? The answer depends on P.E.D 
- Inelastic - Total Revenue increases as price increases because although they sell less units, they are earning more per unit 
- Elastic - Total Revenue increases as price decreases because although you earn less per unit, you are selling more units

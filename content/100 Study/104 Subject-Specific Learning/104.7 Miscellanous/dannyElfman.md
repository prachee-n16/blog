title: Influence of Synthesizers in Popular Music
---
MUSIC 246: A random lecture I made my way in~

Popular musicians, who are largely self-taught took advantage of the cheap cost of keyboard synthesizers, which can make almost any sound possible.
- MIDI (**Musical Instrument Digital Interface**) and Personal Computers were also attributed to the rise of popular music, because we can make complicated scores without having a strong understanding of score music. 

Danny Elfman is an example of this, attached: See Home studio of a composer. 
- Born in 1953 with not a particular illustrious music career in his growing age (not a born talent)
- He was inspired by Bernard Herrman and The Day the Earth Stood Still
	- He's self-taught guitarist and keyboard player, and his career takes off through his brother's theatre group (the name of this is really funny)
		- He starts to write accompaniments and musical theatre music
	- His first piece was a movie called Forbidden Zone by the theatre group. It wasn't successful, the group split apart...
- The musicians of the theatre group joined together to make a band called "Oingo Boingo"
	- Their first piece together was Weird Science (a movie about two science nerds making the perfect girl). The song is catchy, classic 80's pop. 
- His breakthrough was Pee Wee's Big Adventure directed by Tim Burton. 
	- His secret weapon was MIDI and PC's which allows him to set up a sophisticated setup. He uses synthesizers to set up orchestra level music from his home.
	- Steve Bartock was his next weapon, from the group Oingo Boingo. He was a classist musician with experience in arranging and orchestrating for orchestras.
	- View Arrival - Opening Scene
- Elfmann's style has some very clear characteristics. Here's his interpretation:
	- Frantic/Carnivalesque (child-like in a nightmarish way)
		- There's a picture he paints here that I'd recommend hearing the recording for. It's a creepy smile of a parking ticket collector. There's a hint of corruption lurking underneath a cheery sort of tone.
		- It's child-like, sounds you can associate with childhood but there's a nightmarish quality to it
	- Frequent use of 3/4 time (waltz rhythm) and 2/4 (polka rhythm)
		- He loves dance rhythms, with waltz and very quick polka's. There's an example he plays here for that polka rhythm: Main theme of Simpsons I believe. he constantly leaks in dissonance into his work. 
	- Frequent use of glockenspiel/celeste, low woodwinds, harp glissandi, and wordless choir
		- Celeste is essentially the box of the piano but filled with glockenspiel. Advantage of this is because you use mallets, and with celeste you can play with the finesse of a piano player
			- Example: Consider the nutcracker played with Celeste or HP theme song to understand that effect
		- Harp Glissandi drives the action in action sequences and rapid scale passages. This is notable in Simpson's theme song as well. 
		- _Wordless chorus_ is an important tool. When a choir is used in glory, that instantly grabs our attention. In wordless choir, we hear a presence but we don't hear the thoughts being articulated. It's a presence, like someone is watching the film with you and anticipation.
			- Example: Edward Scissorhands 
		- He has written a lot of music for Tim Burton, leading to many successful collaborations. Tim's style is surreal and his style of composing works well with this. 
	- Hitting the action - to the point of "Mickey mousing"
		- Beetlejuice! Note: i love this movie, you should totes watch it. The premise of the scene is extensive, the details of this is unnecessary. The point is that the music is fast, he mickey mouses more than Mickey steiner.
		- *I zoned out, listen to the recording* Something about Beetlejuice using the violin because it's demonic 
	- Example: Edward Scissorhands

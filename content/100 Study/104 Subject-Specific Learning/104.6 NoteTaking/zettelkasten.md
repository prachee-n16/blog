title: Zettelkasten
---
Note: I'm referencing [zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method) to understand how to incorporate this into my daily note-taking!

Contrary to what a "[[zettel]]" should be, i.e. adhere to principle of atomicity and be "hyper-textual", I am not placing any such constraints here. While I will try to achieve this, my main goal is to familiarize myself with how it works. 

In this system, it is recommended that there are no categories as explained in this article: [Why Categories for Your Note Archive are a Bad Idea](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/)

However, this isn't the most suitable for my style. I need a way to differentiate my personal items from work or school. So, let's keep them really general! For now, internally, the four major categories are:
- **PERSONAL**: Related to health, finance, personal logs etc
- **WORK**: Related to internships, resumes, etc
- **STUDY**: Related to true knowledge items, things I'm learning currently
I will try my best to avoid subcategories, but I can see situations where it's better to have order over an organic structure.

> [!tip] When starting out, ask yourself:
>  **Is your Zettelkasten designed for a single writing project or topic, or do you want to map all you know with this tool?**

I want to map everything I know! I want to create a place where I can write about everything I'm learning and connect it to other concepts I've learned. This ecosystem will benefit from overview notes as gentle intros to a topic, similar to this note.

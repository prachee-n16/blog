Remember, OS is a Illusionist and Referee
- It is an illusion that each processor has it's own processor with infinite memory capacity
- However, the reality is it's sharing limited resources (processor and memory)
- We achieve this illusion by multiplexing memory and processors!

There are three aspects to consider about memory management:
1. [[Memory Allocation|Allocation/Deallocation]]: Partition memory among processes and OS itself
2. Translation: From almost infinite virtual address space to physical memory
3. Protection and Communication: Protects OS from application process and application process themselves; at the same time, allow for mutual sharing data

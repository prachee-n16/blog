*Markup language that provides rules to define data*
- tags in XML are markup symbols to define data
	- allows for data coding to get information flows across systems
- XML schema (XSD): document that describes rules on structure of XML file
- XML parser: process or read XML files to extract data, check syntax or validate against schema
- Note: While similar in appearances, this is different from HTML
	- ability to define custom tags, as opposed to pre-defined HTML tags
	- HTML is for content, XML stores and transports data
	- XML is case-sensitive, HTML is not.

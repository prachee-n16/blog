title: C4 Model
---
It is a lean (i.e. improve efficiency and quality) graphical notation technique for modelling software architecture. It is based on a hierarchal tree structure of one system into containers and components. It relies on two modelling techniques:
- UML
	- Classes and instances of a class, and other class-related concepts such as private and public variables
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams
	- It represents a thing a business needs to perform a business process

There are multiple viewpoints we can show here:
- Context Diagrams: Show system and relationships with users and systems
- Container Diagrams: Decompose system to containers i.e. an application or data store
- Component Diagrams: Decompose containers into interrelated components and relate components to other containers or systems
- Code Diagrams: use UML/ERD to provide architecture elements to map into code

Algorithm: Set of steps that transforms an input to desired output, often to solve some computational problem
Data Structures: Way to store and organize data 

Why is [[sorting|sorting]] considered to be important?
- When we talk about ordering a sequence of *n* numbers, each number represents a *key* which is linked to some data (or satellite data)
	- Together, key + satellite data makes a record

Pseudocode conventions:
- Indentation shows block structure, similar to how python works
	- Why? Using begin/end statements introduces clutter and parentheses is not readable or easy to keep track of
- For looping constructs, to shows the loop counter increases and down to shows loop counter decrements 
	- `for i to n`: i increases till n+1 is reached
	- `for i downto n`: i decreases till n-1 is reached
- `A[i]` accesses the i element in A, and `A[i:j]` selects the subarray of A from index i to j
- keyword error shows error has occurred, no need for error handling

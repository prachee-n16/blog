Dataflow diagrams are "data dependency" graphs illustrating a computation
- they divide complex computations into "pipelined" computations that span over several clock periods

They can be used to do the following:
- design datapath-centric systems using a disciplined approach
- estimate area and performance of designs
- explore advantage and disadvantage of different design options

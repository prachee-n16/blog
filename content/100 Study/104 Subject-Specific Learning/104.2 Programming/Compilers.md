A program that
- transforms source code to machine code
- (or) transforms input string to structured output
- (or) translate programs from high-level [[Programming language|programming language]] (hide details through abstractions) to low-level language (exposes underlying hardware)

In detail, it is a program that
- transforms input string to tree (parsing)
- optimizes that tree
- transforms the tree to a structured output (code generation)

In the process of translation,
- compiler checks input program for "correctness"
- optimizes the code
- links to code libraries
- generates binary/executable
- program output must be "functionally equivalent" to input program

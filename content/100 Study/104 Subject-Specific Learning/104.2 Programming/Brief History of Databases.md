- 1950's and early 1960's: Early Transistor-Based Programmable Digital Computers
	- Input was given through punched cards; each card had a series of holes which represented instructions or data
	- The main storage medium was magnetic tapes
- Late 1960s and 1970s: Hard disks
	- Hard disks allowed more direct access to data at faster speeds

- 2000s:
	- XML and XQuery standards introduced
	- Also, unstructured and semi-structured data starts to replace the usual structured data pattern
- 2010s:
	- Efforts made in scalability by combining NoSQL systems with relational model; e.g. VoltDB, MemSQL, CockroachDB
	- Larger emphasis on cybersecurity 
- 2020s:
	- cloud-native DBs
	- integration with AI

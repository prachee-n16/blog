Essentially, a single note on one particular topic! The anatomy of a zettel looks like:
- Unique Identifier: an unambiguous address
	- This is mandatory! Why? Cause it allows for a unique way to identify each note. There are some ways we can go about achieving this!
	- Luhmann-ID
		- It's a hierarchy and sort of similar to how indexing with bullet points work. You have Note 1 and Note 2, and a note between this would be called Note 1a
	- Time-based ID + Arbit. unique string
		- This is what i'm going to use since Obsidian has support for this. Note, each [[Zettel]] will end up having it's own unique string i.e. "title" anyways.
- Body/Content: the actual content
- Footer/References: source of knowledge or personal thoughts
	- Also, consider [[Collector's Fallacy]]
When adding links to other content, there needs to be an explanation as to why it is there! If not, this is not knowledge but information!
- This was an interesting point mentioned somewhere in: https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#luhmann-s-zettelkasten. How do we categorize text as "knowledge" or "information"? Even better, how do I know what I am writing is knowledge (very critical for zettelkasten)!
	- Well, information is "dead" - it needs processing for it to give any relevant information. If I write out all the calories I consumed in a day, that's just information on by daily eating habits. Knowledge would be to dissect this and make some inferences. 

There are a few things to consider in terms of actual contents: Writing the note, expanding the note, and when has it become too inflated. 
- Keep a draft outline which involves bulletting ideas 
- When expanding a note: add items to a collection, add references to back up a point or write a text to incorporate new knowledge. 
- There's no universal guideline to know when it's too big, but re-reading notes and considering if it can be broken down further.

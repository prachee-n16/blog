This was a thought experiment by Valentino Braitenberg.

In the simplest form of this experiment, a *Braitenberg vehicle* is a machine with a light sensor and a motor. The two are connected such that the motor turns on when the sensor detects light, and turns off when the sensor detects no light. So, this gives the effect that the vehicle seeks out light sources.

Hence, the sensor-motor wiring gives rise to interesting effects. Note, this seems intelligent (to be moving towards light source) but is completely decentralized.

**Agents**
- System that processes data, produces an output from input
- Reflex agent - reacts to input, Memory agent - reacts to maybe past decisions

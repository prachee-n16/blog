title: About Me
---
Welcome! I'm **Prachee Nanda** and I'm a third year studying [[computerEng|Computer Engineering]] with Artificial Intelligence Option at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I'm a full stack web developer and an ardent, lifelong learner who is always creating and learning awesome stuff.

I love solving problems! Whether it's finding the most elegant way to write a line of code or solving riveting sudoku puzzles, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions.   My fascination with solving problems, combined with my competitive nature, has influenced me to participate in various public speaking competitions, math contests, business case presentations, and hackathons over the past few years. 

When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you can find me obsessing over two-dimensional characters, sketching, gaming, or photography.
